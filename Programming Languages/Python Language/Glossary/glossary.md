## Dynamically Typed 

In a dynamically typed language, a variable does not have a fixed data type. The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable.

e.g.

In Java data type of the variable has to be declared like this

```java
int intvar = 90;
```

But In Python just `intvar = 90` that's it.
